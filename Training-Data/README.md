## NOTES:

### 1) Here is a brand new MIDI processor for Perceiver
### 2) This processor can handle both Solo Piano and Multi-Instrumental MIDIs
### 3) Provided code/colab uses LAKH MIDI dataset because it is a good baseline. However, you are welcome to try it on something like MMD MIDI dataset or GiantMIDI dataset (for Solo Piano).
### 4) Updated training/generating code/colabs will be added shortly.
